This package provides a Service Provider that allows you to very easily integrate Glide into a Laravel project.

## Installation


You can install the package through Composer.

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-glide
```

You must install this service provider.

```php

// Laravel 4: app/config/app.php

'providers' => [
    ...
    'Spatie\Glide\GlideServiceProvider',
    ...
];
```

You can publish the config file of the package using artisan.

```bash
php artisan config:publish spatie/laravel-glide
```

The options in the config file are set with sane default values and they should be self-explanatory.
